\section{Conclusions}
\label{conc}

Conclusion text...

Length: 0.25-0.5 pages max (1-2 pgfs)

Summary of key contributions (should match your design goals).
Not summary of whole paper.  Any novel contributions mentioned.
Summarize good eval results.

Key: give reader the "take home" message.

\paragraph{Future Work}
%
Future work text...

Typical length: 0.25-0.33 pages max

Don't write too much:
- the more you write, the more work appears "premature"
- takes up important space (small impact on acceptance)

Often folded as subsection of conclusions.

Describe most important 1-3 "novel/research" future work ideas.

Avoid "short term" future goals.  Focus on long-term goals, well
beyond the scope of THIS paper.  Avoid stuff that might be
considered as should have been part of this work.

Give reader some ideas of HOW you plan to go about investigating
future ideas.
